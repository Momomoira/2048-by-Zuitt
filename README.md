**Project Goal & Purpose**

Zuitt is an internationally recognized startup company that offers quality IT education, featuring skill-building lectures through programs such as their online Tech Career Program and Japanese Language Program.

An organization I am part of, Microsoft Student Community PLM, entered into a partnership with Zuitt. One of the benefits of this partnership was access to a free game development bootcamp. As part of this bootcamp, we were taught how to create a web-based version of the classic game 2048 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2048 is a single-player puzzle game where players slide numbered tiles across a grid using arrow keys, merging matching numbers to form higher values until they reach the tile with a value of 2048. Itâ€™s easy to understand, simple to play, and enjoyable for users of all ages. For this project, images from Zuitt were used to replace the usual numbers on the tiles, creating a more challenging and personalized game experience.

The bootcamp provided beginner-friendly lessons that supported participants with little to no web development experience. By the end of the session, each participant had successfully built a fully functional 2048 game.
